# TripSit Moderation Team Charter

**This charter defines the key roles and guiding principles of the TripSit moderation team.**

TripSit exists to create a safe, inclusive space focused on harm reduction, wellness, and support. The TripSit team isn’t here to “rule” the community – it’s here to maintain an environment where everyone feels safe, heard, and respected.  

Roles in this document **distribute responsibility, not authority.** Everyone has a voice, and major decisions happen through discussion and consensus whenever possible.

---

## 🌱 Role Rotation

To keep things fresh, avoid burnout, and prevent anyone from “owning” a role forever, **Operator** and **Leadership** roles rotate regularly.

- **Nomination cycle:** Every 6 months (or sooner if needed), we open nominations.
  - Anyone can nominate any team member for a role, including themselves.
  - Anyone can decline a nomination – no guilt, no pressure.
- **Voting:** After a week of nominations, if more than two people are up for a role, we vote.
  - Voting is a **public poll** among team members, based on “Who do you think would serve this role best right now?”
- **Transition:** If you aren’t selected, you’re still an important part of the team. Step back gracefully, keep contributing, and you can nominate again next round.

✅ *Why?* This keeps TripSit’s leadership healthy, distributes skills, and avoids the trap of “titles becoming thrones.” It also allows people to gracefully do their term and if they don't enjoy it they can step down without pressure.

## 🏛 Core Roles

These don’t rotate – they’re foundational to the health and stability of TripSit.

### Director
**Currently held by:** Moonbear

**Purpose:**  
Provides long-term stability for TripSit’s infrastructure and vision.

**Responsibilities:**  
- Pays bills and fees that keep TripSit alive.
- Ensures servers, hosting, and TripBot run smoothly.

**Qualities in a future Director:**  
Moonbear is willing to "transfer" the position to someone else if there was a willing candidate that could take over all the necessary responsibilites and has the necessary qualities: Infinite patience, financial stability (you might need to front server costs), and ideally harm reduction experience.

Operators keep TripSit’s systems running. They are *not* “above” moderators.

These roles **rotate every 6 months** for fresh ideas while keeping enough stability for the services they manage.

### Discord Coordinator
**Currently held by:** Rooni
