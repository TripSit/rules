Welcome to the TripSit IRC Network. We have created a ruleset to help communicating with each other while maintaining a comfortable atmosphere.

Should you witness a user breaking one of these rules, use the **~report** command (**~report #channel user reason**) to notify the TripSit [staff](http://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/List_of_staff_and_their_roles).
