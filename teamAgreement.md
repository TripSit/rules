🌈 The TripSit Agreement

TripSit exists to help people — with patience, inclusivity, non‑judgement, and care for everyone’s wellness. By being part of this team, I’m committing to embody those values every day, with our community and with each other.
I pledge to:

    🕊️ Lead with patience. I’ll take a breath before I react, offer guidance with kindness, and remember that everyone learns and heals at their own pace.

    🌍 Be inclusive. I’ll welcome people of all genders, backgrounds, abilities, and identities, and points of view — and shut down behavior that makes others feel unwelcome.

    💛 Practice non‑judgement. I won’t criticize or shame anyone for who they are, what they look like, what they’re going through, or if they have a different point of view.

    🌱 Support wellness. I’ll look out for the mental, emotional, and physical health of both our community and our team, and ask for help when I need it too.

    🤗 Build each other up. I’ll celebrate wins, offer help, and treat teammates and community members like we’re all on the same side — because we are.

✨ Why this matters

TripSit is more than a space — it’s a lifeline for many. The way we treat each other sets the tone for how we treat the people who come here for support. By honoring this pledge, we create the kind of community we all needed at some point in our lives.
🛡️ If the pledge is broken

This pledge isn’t about finger‑pointing — it’s about staying true to TripSit’s mission.

    If someone slips, they’ll get a reminder about the pledge and the values we share.

    If hurtful behavior keeps happening, a one‑on‑one talk will happen to find a way forward.

    If someone can’t or won’t honor the pledge, leadership may need to step in — because protecting this space of patience, inclusivity, and non‑judgement is what keeps TripSit alive.

✅ My Commitment

By being part of this team, I promise to uphold the TripSit pledge — for the good of our team, our community, and the mission we all believe in.
