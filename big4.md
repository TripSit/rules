- You can be banned without warning if you do not follow the rules!
- The "Big 4" rules are below, but generally be positive, be safe, and dont buy/sell stuff and you'll be fine.
- If you need to clarify anything you can review the full unabridged network rules: https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Rules 
- The moderators reserve the right to remove those who break the 'spirit' of the rules, even if they don't break any specific rule.
- If you see something against the rules or something that makes you feel unsafe, let the team know. We want this server to be a welcoming space!

🔞 1. You must be over 18 to participate in most channels!
- We believe that minors will use substances regardless of the info available to them so the best we can do is educate properly and send them on their way.
- 🟢│tripsit allows minors to get help from a tripsitter.
- We appreciate the support, but beyond this it is our belief that minors have more productive activitives than contributing to a harm reduction network <3

💊 2. No Sourcing!
- Don't post anything that would help you or others acquire drugs; legal or illegal, neither in the server nor in DMs.
- Assume anyone attempting to buy or sell something is a scammer. Report scammers to the team to get a (virtual) cookie.
- You may source harm reduction supplies and paraphernalia, providing that the source doesn't distribute any substances.
- No self-promotion (server invites, advertisements, etc) without permission from a staff member.

💀 3. Do not encourage unsafe usage!
- Don't encourage or enable dangerous drug use; don't spread false, dangerous, or misleading information about drugs.
- Keep your dosage information and stash private unless it's relevant to a question. Posting absurd dosages to get a reaction will receive a reaction (a ban).
- Hard drug use (beyond nicotine or THC) or driving on camera is not allowed in the voice rooms.
- No substance identification - no one can tell you which drugs, or how much of them, you have just by looking at them. #harm-reduction

❤️ 4. Treat everyone with respect!
- Don't participate in behaviour that purposefully causes discomfort to others.
- Don't submit anything that drastically disturbs the flow of chat without providing any added value.
- That includes: Mic spam, reaction spam, taking six messages to formulate one sentence, etc.
- Don't post content that is unnecessarily inflammatory, provocative, or controversial. Read the atmosphere, and recognize when you've gone too far.
